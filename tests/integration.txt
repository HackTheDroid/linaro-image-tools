A few integration tests we can run while the migration to python is not
complete.  They probably require root or access to specific block devices so
they are not meant to be automated.

    # This should print nothing to stdout but will create a binary/ dir under
    # the current directory.
    >>> python -m media_create.unpack_binary_tarball <path-to-binary-tarball>

    # This will remove the binary/ dir created above
    >>> python -m media_create.remove_binary_dir

    # Partition (for real!) /dev/sdb for a beagle board and return the devices
    # for the boot and root partitions.
    >>> python -m media_create.partitions /tmp/out_file beagle /dev/sdb 32 2G
    ...     boot root ext3 2e82008e-1af3-4699-8521-3bf5bac1e67a yes
    ...     format-bootfs format-rootfs
    Checking that no-one is using this disk right now
    ...
    >>> cat /tmp/out_file
    BOOTFS=/dev/sdb1 ROOTFS=/dev/sdb2

    # Partition /tmp/beagle.img for a beagle board and return the loopback
    # devices for the boot and root partitions.
    >>> python -m media_create.partitions /tmp/out_file beagle /tmp/beagle.img
    ...     32 2G boot root ext3 2e82008e-1af3-4699-8521-3bf5bac1e67a yes
    ...     format-bootfs format-rootfs
    Warning: /tmp/beagle.img is not a block device
    ...
    >>> cat /tmp/out_file
    BOOTFS=/dev/loop0 ROOTFS=/dev/loop1
